title: 'Squid & Super Karoiju Starfighter'
---

This project is divided in two parts :

- Squid : A collection of libraries, built on [citro2d](https://github.com/devkitPro/citro2d), [citro3d](https://github.com/devkitPro/citro3d) and [libctru](https://github.com/devkitPro/libctru) from the [devkitARM](https://github.com/devkitPro?type=source) toolchain to create 3DS homebrew games more easily.
- Super Karoiju Starfighter : A game to test the features I create.

Creating and populating a scene is very similar to my other project [Blah Thingy]({{ site.github.url }}/projects/proj-blah).
