I've been creating games with Processing, GameMaker, Godot and Unity (even ROM hacking) for many years now, here's some of my recents experiments !

#### Project Karoiju

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="SPCbvTvk6vA" %}

With this project I wanted to learn the whole process between creating a character mesh, animation and textures to its Unity implementation.
I've written my own character controller logic, based on raycasts.

I've modeled, rigged and animated this character with Blender and did the texture with Photoshop.

*The character animations are pretty rough, it was my first experience animating in 3D. But I've learn a lot !*

*It was my first time texture painting aswell !*
