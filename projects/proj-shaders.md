One of my favorite aspect of game making is playing around with shaders !

#### Godot Grass Shader

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="-Wxpqo_JlME" %}

{% include image.html image="projects/proj-shaders/grass_shader_params.png" %}
*Godot supports curves and gradients as shader parameters out of the box ! Unlike Unity...*

#### Godot Snow Shader

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="3WuWvz3K0ic" %}

*The main challenge of this shader was to know how to interpolate between two materials dynamically. A dynamic texture act as canvas where a smooth brush paints over it, following a moving object. This trick allows any numbers of objects interacting with the canvas. The snow shader got a little vertex offset to give a coat aspect.*

#### Unity Seaweed

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="EmfIuB-6hOw" %}

*Each seaweed has a random color, oscillation frequence, amplitude and direction based on its position.*
